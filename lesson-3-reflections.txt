When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    For important data such as code, we are better off using a remote repository than keeping all work local. This pratice of employing a remote repository helps mitigates the risk of data loss. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It is extremly likely that many people/parties collabrate in large projects and therefore have access to the remote repository. Having Git automatically stay up-to-date with the remote may lead to too many commits being pulled than desired. Manually pulling changes from remote offers the discretion we want.
